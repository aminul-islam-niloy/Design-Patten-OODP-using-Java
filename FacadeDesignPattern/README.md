## Getting Started
The facade pattern is similar to a facade in architecture. It's an object that serves as a front-facing interface that hides more complex underlying or structural code.
The facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a more complex logic or functionality. It hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client

## Problem Statement:
Write a Java program to demonstrate the implementation of a fa√ßade design pattern for a Banking Service with Checking, Saving, and Investment modules.

## Components

The banking system consists of the following major components:

- **Account Interface**: An interface that defines common banking operations such as deposit, withdraw, transfer, and getAccountNumber.

- **ChequingAccount**: A class implementing the Account interface for chequing accounts.

- **SavingAccount**: A class implementing the Account interface for saving accounts.

- **InvestmentAccount**: A class implementing the Account interface for investment accounts.

- **BankService**: A service class that manages accounts using a Hashtable. It provides methods to create new accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and transfer money between accounts.

- **Customer**: A class that demonstrates the usage of the banking system by creating accounts and performing transactions.

## Usage

To use the banking system:

1. Create instances of different types of accounts using the `BankService` class.

2. Deposit money into accounts using the `depositMoney` method.

3. Withdraw money from accounts using the `withdrawMoney` method.

4. Transfer money between accounts using the `transferMoney` method.
